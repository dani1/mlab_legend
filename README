OVERVIEW: 
Scripts for Matlab to modify some legend properties.
These scripts are some useful tools to change in a 
simple way the size of the legend as in (resizeleg.m),
or to remove or resize the lines shown in the legend
entries (onlymarkersinleg, resizelinesleg.m).

USAGE:
The scripts usage is described in the files.

MAIN ADVANTAGES:
Matlab is a very powerful tool, but it has some 
annoying features which are not implemented directly.

resizeleg permits e.g. to shring the legend vertically,
squeezing the text closer together vertically and using 
less space horizontally.
In combination the other two scripts permit to shift the
text spacing in the legend, reducing the size used by 
the symbols in the legend (lines, markers, markers+lines)
